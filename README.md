apv-median
----------

This is a C99 library for estimating medians from large datasets
in a streaming fashion. See the [documentation](doc/README.md) for
further details.

Compilation of this code needs the [Jannson][1] library for the
serialisation and deserialisation of the histogram structure to JSON.
