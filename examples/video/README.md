Histogram evolution
-------------------

This a small Python script which uses the output of the `dumper`
program in the sibling directory of the same name, reads and
converts those files to a format readable by MatPlotLib's _bar_
plotter, which generate PNG files; these then converted to a video
using _ffmpeg_.
