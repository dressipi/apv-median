Examples
--------

Some standalone applications of the library, for creating
pictures and videos etc, so we can get a visual hook into
the operation of the library.

Typically these need some extra software (like the Generic
Mapping Tools) in order to actually make the plots, these
are not checked by `../configure`, you're pretty much on
you own here.
